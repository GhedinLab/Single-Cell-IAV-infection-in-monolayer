# Single-Cell-IAV-infection-in-monolayer

This repository contains codes used to analyze single cell and bulk RNA-seq data in the study of defective viral genomes (DVG) during influenza A virus (IAV) infection. 

The Python scripts used for data pre-processing and DVG identification can be found in the "Python" fold.
The R functions used for down-stream analysis and data visualization can be found in the R markdown files in the "R" fold.
The workflow of the analysis was described in the "Other_pipeline_files" fold.
